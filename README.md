"DO NOT CHANGE ANY OF THE CODE!!! :D ehe" 

A simple, not very confusing Date calculator.
I created this code to simplify tasks that were assigned to me during my ITE internship,
where i needed to calculate the difference in dates and the converting days to months.

Hope it can help people simplify their work even a little. Tell me if there any problems or improvements i can do :DD
